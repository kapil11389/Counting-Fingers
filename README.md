# CNN Counting-Fingers
A CNN deep learning model that counts the number of fingers held up by the hand using Keras , TensorFlow as backend and OpenCV

The Model surpisingly gives correct results on the combination of fingers held never seen by it.

# Requirments

Python 3.5+ , Keras 2+ , Tensorflow 2+, OpenCV 4.3+

NVIDIA 940MX GPU was used for speedy computation when training the model
